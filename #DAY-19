#DAY-19 of our 30DaysofML series 

Today's topic : Principal component analysis (PCA) 
- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html ( it covers PCA concepts, implementation steps, and code examples using Python's scikit-learn library)

Failure Cases of PCA:

1. Non-linear Data: PCA assumes a linear relationship between features. If the data is inherently non-linear, PCA won't effectively capture its underlying structure.
2. Irrelevant Features: If your data has irrelevant features, PCA may not identify the most important components for analysis. Consider feature selection techniques before applying PCA.
3. High Dimensionality: While PCA reduces dimensions, it can be computationally expensive for very high-dimensional data. Consider alternative dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE in such cases

Remember, PCA is a powerful tool, but it has limitations. It's crucial to understand these limitations and choose the right technique for your specific data and problem
